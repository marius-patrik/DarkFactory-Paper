  // is not the gap that appears on the page. Measured in the built PDF with
  // `bun ../.darkfactory/plugins/thesis/scripts/measure-paragraph-gap.ts ../PAPER.pdf`, the extra space introduced is
  // `spacing - 11.7pt`: 24pt measured 12.3pt, 12pt measured 0.3pt. 19.7pt therefore targets the
  // required 8pt gap. Re-measure after any change to the leading, the size, or this value -
  // `spacing: 12pt` here looks like compliance and is no gap at all.
