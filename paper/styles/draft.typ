// Draft passages.
//
// Some of the writing is provisional: an argument that is still being weighed, or a
// stage of the practical part that may not survive to the submitted version. Rather
// than leave such passages indistinguishable from settled text — or park them in a
// separate file where they stop being readable in context — they are wrapped in
// `draft[]` and printed in a marked block.
//
// The point is that a reader can tell at a glance which claims are load-bearing.
// Everything inside a `draft[]` block is unconfirmed: it may be reworded, cut, or
// contradicted by later work without the rest of the thesis being invalidated.
//
// Currently no passage in ./pages uses this: the provisional material that motivated
// it was either resolved or moved to the follow-up thesis, and the one that remained
// became an ordinary paragraph. The module is kept because provisional writing is
// expected to recur — in particular when the follow-up thesis is drafted — and a
// marking that only exists once the need for it is gone is not much use. It is
// referenced from styles/main.typ, so `#show: apply` already makes it available.
//
// To find live passages: `grep -rn 'draft\[' pages/`
// To drop one: delete the whole block. Nothing outside it depends on a draft passage,
// so removal needs no other edit. Keep draft passages free of headings and figures,
// so that deleting one cannot leave a dangling outline entry or figure number.
